Here is some markdown text:

<markdown>
{markdown}
</markdown>

As an expert in language understanding and markdown formatting you are tasked to review the provided markdown.

Please only analyze the headers in this markdown text, and write your analysis inside <analyze> tags. Your analysis should focus on the text of the header not the hierarchical relations between headers. Remember that headers usually contain keywords not full sentences. They describe the topic of the next paragraph but also make sense by themselves.

Then, correct the header formatting in the markdown text based on your analysis. Only remove header formatting (eg. #, ##, ##).
Do not add new headers and do not remove text.

If the headers are already formatted correctly make no changes.

Provide the corrected markdown text inside <corrected_markdown> tags.
