# Chaucer's English Period

## The Canterbury Tale:
Canterbury Tale: Chaucer's most famous, influential, ambitious, masterpiece and most celebrated work in English literature, but unfinished.
* It was a collection of 24 stories/tales, consisting of approximately 17,000 lines, written in the Middle English dialect of London in the past tense.

Chaucer's long poem follows the journey of a group of pilgrims, 31 including Chaucer himself, from the Tabard Inn in Southwark to St. Thomas à Becket's shrine at Canterbury Cathedral, through Thames river. The Host, Harry Bailey, suggests each pilgrim tell two tales on the way out and two on the way home, and the best storyteller is to be rewarded with a free supper on their return.

Original plan = 120 (Each pilgrim to tell = 4 tales, two while going and 2 while returning)
Total pilgrims = 30
Each pilgrim tells on  30*4 = 120    but completed 24 only

Although 29 pilgrims are mentioned in the "General Prologue", then the Narrator joins the group, making 30. The Host, Harry Bailey makes 31. The Canon's Yeoman who joins the group, added makes 32.

The Narrator gives a description of 27 pilgrims (except 'Nun's Tale' or 'Nun's Priest's')

The Canterbury Tales have the characters from 3 social groups:
1. Nobility  2. Church  3. Commoners
